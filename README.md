# hello-world
my first repository

Hello Programmers,
itÂ´s a pleasure to get to know you. 
Let me tell you a bit about myself:
Most importanly : I have a collection  of over 14.000 memes. 
I also have toilet paper and desinfection stuff, so hit me up if i you want any of the above.

Have a wonderful day or night(probably night as I know my fellow computer science guys) and stay safe!

Love all of you!

Julia
